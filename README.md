# OpenAI Conversation
A wrapper around OpenAI's `davinci` GPT-3 model that allows you to talk to it. Using Google Cloud's
[Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/) and [Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/)
APIs, it transcribes speech to text, passes the text to GPT-3, and then speaks the response back to you.
